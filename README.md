# V_rep-obstacle-avoidance
This project demonstrates how a neural network provides obstacle avoidance in a V-Rep environment.
Neural network was trained on a simple dataset, you can see it in "/data" dir. 
Neural network saved in "nn.h5" file.

Steps to run the demonstration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Keras must be installed.
V-Rep must be installed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1). In V-rep open scene "/map/environment with cubes 8x8.ttt"
2). Launch the main.py to start simulation
